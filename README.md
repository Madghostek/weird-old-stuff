* pygame-bilard - Made in high school after leaning what elastic collisions are, incomplete but cool, code is pretty good quality
* socketio-chat - Probably my oldest surviving project that i put effort into, very simple internet chat made in Nodejs, the UI looks horrible though. based on tutorial
* pygame-connectfour - The most atrocious version of connectfour you've ever seen, made as a joke during free time on IT lessons. There is a bug in win checking, try to find it
* mini-projects - random *very very old* projects without purpose, mostly with p5.js
